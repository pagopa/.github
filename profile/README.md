# Introduction

PagoPA's software repositories are organized in three different GitHub organizations:
- active projects are maintained here [**@pagopa**](https://github.com/pagopa);
- archived projects are stored [**@pagopa-archive**](https://github.com/pagopa-archive);
- R&D projects are developed [**@pagopa-research**](https://github.com/pagopa-research).

As such, from time to time some repositories are moved from one organization to another. This is done to keep the main organization clean and tidy, and to archive projects that are no longer maintained.

## Contacts
Should you have any inquiry regarding the projects, please open an issue in the relevant repository.
